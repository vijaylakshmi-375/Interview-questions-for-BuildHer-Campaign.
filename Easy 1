#Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. 
#code is in python

 def print_lastwordlength():  # function to get the length of the last word
        word = input("enter the word:")
        word.strip() # removes the white spaces off at the begining and after the completeion of the sentence entered.
        l = len(word)
        count=0
        for i in reversed (range (0,l+1)): # navigate the sentence from the last as to get the last word first
            if(word[i]!= ' '):  # if the there's no white space encounered, its still the last word
                count= count+1  # counts the number of the words until the whitespace
        
            break # breaks right after the first whitespace since its completed counting letters in the last word.
    
        print(count)
